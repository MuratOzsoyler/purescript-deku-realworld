# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### purescript-deku codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://deku-realworld.netlify.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **purescript-deku** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the ****purescript-deku** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

Deku is a framework for building reactive apps using the PureScript language.

This app uses idiomatic Deku patterns, including:

- HTML templating. Like Svelte, Deku apps often start with plain HTML, filling in bits of the template with logic as you go along.
- A hooks-like syntax for specifying getters and setters.
- Reusable logic and components for elements like follow buttons and favorite icons.

For more information on basic Deku patterns, check out the [deku documentation](https://mikesol.github.io/purescript-deku).
