# Functional programming

Deku is a micro-framework. It relies heavily on existing PureScript libraries such as `hyrule` and `effect`, both of which are over seven years old and exploit battle-tested functional patterns.

We've already gone over how Deku uses [`Event`-s](./events.md) from [`hyrule`](https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-hyrule). This document will explore some other common libraries used in Deku apps.
